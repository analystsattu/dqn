Here we implement DeepMind's Deep Q-Networks and Double Deep Q-Networks using python from scratch.

We use these two algorthims to solve 2 OpenAI Gym environments - [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) and [Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/).

 The python notebook shows how the algorithm learns the two environments.
